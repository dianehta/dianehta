I am very proud of my latest project: a state digital government platform.
This platform consists of 4 collaboration platforms:
1.	Open data: datos.slp.gob.mx
2.	Georeferenced Information Center: mapas.slp.gob.mx
3.	Digital procedures and services: trámites.slp.gob.mx
4.	Training platform: capacitate.slp.gob.mx

These four platforms make up the comprehensive digital government platform. The primary objective of the platforms is to provide digital services to the citizens of the State of San Luis Potosí in Mexico, through the collaboration of public officials, specialists and experts in different sectors, citizens, companies, academia and organizations of other levels and governing bodies.
